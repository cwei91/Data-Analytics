    "In this project, we are part of a team that is developing a mobile application, which **calculates the probability of winning the 6/49 lottery** to deter addicts from gambling. For the [6/49 lottery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotto_6/49), six numbers are drawn without replacement from a set of 49 numbers that range from 1 to 49. Specifically, we will build functions to determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play multiple different tickets?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having exactly two, three, four or five winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "- What is the probability of having at least two, three, four or five winning numbers on a single ticket?\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also provided with a supplementary set of [historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datascienceai/lottery-dataset) from the national 6/49 lottery game in Canada. \n",
