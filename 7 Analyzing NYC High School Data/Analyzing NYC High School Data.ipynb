    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) is an exam that U.S. high school students take before applying to college. The total SAT score is out of 2,400 possible points, and consists of three sections with 800 possible points each. The scores are considered as a measure of the high school and school district quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to determine the efficacy and fairness of standardized tests by **investigating the correlations between Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores and demographics in New York City**.\n",
    "\n",
    "From our background research, we also learn that:\n",
    "- New York City is made up of five boroughs, which are essentially distinct regions.\n",
    "- New York City schools fall within several different school districts, each of which can contains dozens of schools.\n",
    "- Our datasets include several different types of schools. Only high school students take the SAT, so we'll need to clean them so that we can focus on high schools only.\n",
    "- Each school in New York City has a unique code called a `DBN` or district borough number.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the following datasets in this project:\n",

    "**g. Relation between AP exams and SAT score**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the U.S., high school students take Advanced Placement (AP) exams to earn college credit. There are AP exams for many different subjects. It makes sense that the number of students at a school who took AP exams would be highly correlated with the school's SAT scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore this relationship. Because `total_enrollment` is highly correlated with `sat_score`, we don't want to lead to biased results. Instead, we'll look at the percentage of students in each school who took at least one AP exam."
