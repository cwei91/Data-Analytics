    "b. Sales by Store Employee\n",
    "- The top employee (Jane Peacock) has about 25% more dollar sales than the last employee (Steve Johnson). \n",
    "- This may be attributed to the difference in working duration at the store, since **employees with higher sales were hired at an earlier date**.\n",

    "c. Sales by Country\n",
    "- There may be potential for further expansion in the **Czech Republic, Portugal and India** markets as these countries have the **highest average sales per customer**.\n",
    "- However, it should be noted that the current trend is based on a **small sample size** of 2 existing customers in each of these countries. Therefore, a **slow expansion is recommended** to ascertain whether the average sales remains high for new customers.\n",
